# ðŸŒ€ RELAnalytics

**RELAnalytics** is a recursive entangled logic analytics engine for semantic data streams.  
It interprets `distance` and `label` fields through the **RELA** framework â€” mapping them into voltage, phase (modulus), and semantic current (Î”V), visualized in real-time.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Upload any `.csv` file with `distance` and `label` columns
- Auto-calculates:
  - Voltage field from distance
  - Phase modulation via recursive modulus (RELA logic)
  - Semantic current (Î”V) for logic transitions
- Visual charts: line plots, bar graphs, spirals (optional)
- "Load Demo" button loads synthetic recursive data

## ðŸ§  RELA Model Logic

- `voltage = 1 / (distance + 0.1)`
- `semantic_current = Î”V = difference between voltages`
- `modulus` is derived from label using symbolic rules:
  - pedestrian â†’ 500
  - car â†’ 5000
  - crosswalk â†’ 1000
  - zone â†’ 100
  - stop â†’ 200

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

```bash
cd RELAnalytics
streamlit run app.py
